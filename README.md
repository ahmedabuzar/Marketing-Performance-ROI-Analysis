📊 Marketing Performance & ROI Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

📌 Project Overview

The goal is to support data-driven budget allocation and optimization decisions, similar to what a Data Analyst / Business Analyst would deliver to stakeholders.

🧩 Business Problem

  • Which channels generate the highest ROI
  • Which campaigns or managers drive maximum revenue
  • Where budgets should be optimized vs scaled
This dashboard answers those questions using structured Excel analysis.

🔍 Key Insights
